"Quão longa é a noite do tempo sem limites, comparada ao curto sonho da vida".
(Arthur Schopenhauer)

Existence and pessimism

‘Existence and pessimism’ examines the fourth book of "The World As Will and Representation", which addresses the human condition itself. Schopenhauer finds the world full of suffering — frustration, tedium, pain, and misery. Is this merely a highly selective inventory, perhaps a matter of personal propensity? If so, his pessimism would be superficial and gratuitous. But this is not the case. He has arguments for far-reaching conclusions about the value that can attach to human existence. It must contain suffering, and cannot be preferable to non-existence. It would even have been better for reality not to have existed. These claims make Schopenhauer a pessimist in a philosophically interesting sense.
